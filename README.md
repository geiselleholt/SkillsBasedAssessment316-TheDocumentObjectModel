## Hafa Adai ðŸŒ´

### Welcome to another dynamic project I made for my Per Scholas bootcamp! This one is on DOM Manipulation ðŸŽ‰

### I developed a fun Mad Lib web page that takes words, a number, and a date and puts them into funny stories. Hope you have as much playing it as I did making it!

### We had 2 days to complete this assessment. The 20+ requirements are listed and checked off throughout the code. Here are some of the things I had to demonstrate:
- Use DOM properties, methods, and techniques to create a web application that provides a dynamic user experience.
- Use BOM properties, methods, and techniques to facilitate creation of a dynamic web application.
- Demonstrate proficiency with event-driven programming and DOM events.
- Implement basic form validation using any combination of built-in HTML validation attributes and DOM-event-driven JavaScript validation.
